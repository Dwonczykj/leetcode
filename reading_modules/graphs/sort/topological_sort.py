## ****Algorithm for Topological Sorting using DFS:****

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step algorithm for topological sorting using Depth First Search (DFS):

-   Create a graph with ****n**** vertices and ****m****\-directed edges.
-   Initialize a stack and a visited array of size ****n****.
-   For each unvisited vertex in the graph, do the following:
    -   Call the DFS function with the vertex as the parameter.
    -   In the DFS function, mark the vertex as visited and recursively call the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of the vertex.
    -   Once all the neighbors have been visited, push the vertex onto the stack.
-   After all, vertices have been visited, pop elements from the stack and append them to the output list until the stack is empty.
-   The resulting list is the topologically sorted order of the graph.

## Illustration Topological Sorting Algorithm:

Steps:
Step 1:

We start DFS from node 0 because it has zero incoming Nodes
We push node 0 in the stack and move to next node having minimum number of adjacent nodes i.e. node 1.
file

Step 2:

In this step , because there is no adjacent of this node so push the node 1 in the stack and move to next node.
file

Step 3:

In this step , We choose node 2 because it has minimum number of adjacent nodes after 0 and 1 .
We call DFS for node 2 and push all the nodes which comes in traversal from node 2 in reverse order.
So push 3 then push 2 .
file

Step 4:

We now call DFS for node 4
Because 0 and 1 already present in the stack so we just push node 4 in the stack and return.
file

Step 5:

In this step because all the adjacent nodes of 5 is already in the stack we push node 5 in the stack and return.
file

Step 6: This is the final step of the Topological sorting in which we pop all the element from the stack and print it in that order .

Key Points:
Algorithm:
 - Add all nodes with in-degree 0 to a queue.
 - While the queue is not empty:
    - Remove a node from the queue.
    - For each outgoing edge from the removed node, decrement the in-degree of the destination node by 1.
    - If the in-degree of a destination node becomes 0, add it to the queue.
 - If the queue is empty and there are still nodes in the graph, the graph contains a cycle and cannot be topologically sorted.
 - The nodes in the queue represent the topological ordering of the graph.

How to find the in-degree of each node? 
To find the in-degree of each node by initially calculating the number of incoming edges to each node. 
Iterate through all the edges in the graph and increment the in-degree of the destination node for each edge. 
This way, you can determine the in-degree of each node before starting the sorting process.
